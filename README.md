# Caeser Cipher

## Purpose of the Project
 - The Caeser Cipher website is a site that hopes to encourage a user's interest in encoding messages and cryptography with a simple caeser cipher, allowing users to create, encode and decode messages. The site will be useful to beginners interested in cryptography.   
## Existing Features and User Stories

### Title
 - A simple header to quickly show the user the name of the website and what it is about

### Text area
 - A large box for the user to enter the text they want to encode. 
 - Features a simple message instructing the user

### Text transformation section
 - Features an instruction for the user to enter a correct key input to encode their message
 - Next to this instruction is an input box for the user's key that only takes integers, if the user attempts to enter non-integers, integers outside of the valid range or an empty input they will recieve an alert telling them what to enter. Their message will remain unchanged. 
 - By this is the submit button, this will encode the user's message with their selected key after validation.
 - Next is the Random Key button. This will encode the user's message with a random key, with the transformations of 0 and 26 removed so that the message will always change.
 - The final Clear text button does exactly what it says, removing the old message for the user on click.
 - Finally below these inputs is a message to the user, instructing them on what key to use to decode their message, allowing them to see it again after it has been encoded.

### Explanation section
 - This section explains the workings of the cipher to the user, as well as the limitations of it.

### Footer section
 - The footer contains links to social media, which are valuable to the user because it allows them to share their encryptions and the website on social media.
 - The links open in a new tab for ease of use and to allow the user to return to the site easily.

## Future Features
 - In the future the site can be expanded to show an input and output window allowing the user to see their message before and after it is encoded.
 - A hero image, something to draw the users attention to the project and make the website more memorable.

## Typography and Color Scheme
 - 

## Wireframes
 - A wireframe of the project was planned using Balsamiq.

Having a rough plan of the website while building it was very useful in planning out the html and css parts of the website.

## Testing
 - 

 ### Bug Testing
 - 

## Deployment
### Gitpod
 - Gitpod contains all of the building blocks and commits of the site. 

### Github Pages
 - The finished site was deployed to Github pages, the steps to deploy are:
 - In the github repository, navigate to the settings tab
 - From the source menu select the master or root branch
 - Once selected the page will be refreshed and the site deployed
 - The live link can be found here: https://github.com/EdwardBonner96/second-project-submission
