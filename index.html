        <p>
            The Caeser cipher is one of the oldest known ciphers. It is surprisingly simple and easy to use. For the English
            aplhabet all it requires is a key - a number between 1 and 25 (you can also use 0 and 26 but they won't change the 
            message). Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, you can simply label 'A' as 1, 'B' as 2 and so on until
            you have 'Z' = 26. Then you take your key and add it to the value of each letter. If a letter now has a value of more
            than 26, then you take 26 away from the new value. For example normally 'Z' = 26 and if you have a key of 2, then 
            'Z' = 28 turns into 'Z' = 2. Finally, just transform each letter into its new value. Since we now have 'Z' = 2, this
            means that 'Z' transforms into 'B' - the letter with value 2 in the alphabet.

            The Caeser Cipher has a couple of strengths and a lot of weaknesses. While it is very simple and quick to use to 
            encode a message, it is not much more difficult to break the cipher and find the encoded message. There are many ways
            to analyse the output and glean information from it. Any capitilisation or punctuation could give clues to a letter.
            For example if a letter is by itself and capitalised, it is most likely 'A' or 'I'. Once you know one of the letters,
            you can reverse the process above and figure out the key, breaking the entire code. If the message is too long, it 
            could also be analysed statistically. The most common letter in the english alphabet is 'E' and if your encoded
            message uses a lot of the same letters then the odds are very good one of those letters maps to E.
